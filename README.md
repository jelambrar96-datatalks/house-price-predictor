# House Price Predictor

This repository, jelambrar96-datatalks/house-price-predictor, appears to be a machine learning and deep learning project focused on predicting house prices. The repository likely contains code and data for training and testing models to forecast house prices based on various factors.

## 1. Problem Description

The price of a house depends on a wide range of variables, including its location, size, number of bedrooms, age, proximity to amenities, and even market conditions. Each of these factors interacts with others in complex ways. For example, a small house in a prime location may still be priced higher than a larger house in a less desirable area. Accounting for all these variables and their interactions to predict house prices accurately is an extremely challenging task when approached manually.

Trying to manually develop an algorithm to predict house prices by accounting for all these factors and their relationships can quickly become impractical and overwhelming. Manually developing an algorithm to incorporate and weigh these diverse factors would require an exhaustive amount of time, domain expertise, and effort. Not to mention, the relationships between these variables often involve nonlinear patterns, which are difficult to model with traditional rule-based approaches.

This complexity is precisely why machine learning becomes invaluable. Machine learning models are designed to learn from historical data, identifying patterns and relationships between variables without requiring explicit programming for each scenario. By leveraging these models, we can develop a predictive system that efficiently accounts for the wide array of factors influencing house prices, making accurate and scalable predictions possible.

## 2. Proposed solution

This is where machine learning provides an excellent solution. **Machine learning models** are designed to analyze vast datasets, uncover hidden patterns, and identify relationships between variables. By training a model with historical data on house prices and their associated features, we can build a system capable of making accurate predictions for new houses.
